## MINIMAL MVP - IMMEDIATE TESTING (2-3 Days Total)
**Goal: Test if people will play the SeatJumper game with real money**

### Pre-Launch Setup (1-2 days)
- [ ] Manual Prize Pool Setup (Already Built)
  - Use existing admin inventory page to manually add tickets (100-level, 200-level, cheapest seats)
  - Use existing manual entry to add collectibles ($15 baseball packs + $1,000 grail card)
  - Set bundle price at profitable margin ($50-100 per jump)
- [ ] Test Payment Processing (Already Working)
  - Verify Stripe integration with $1 test transaction
  - Confirm webhook handling works

- [ ] Set game status to ACTIVE
- [ ] Share link with 10-20 friends/early testers
- [ ] Monitor first transactions in Stripe dashboard

### Manual Fulfillment Process

- [ ] For collectible winners: Ship with tracking, send tracking info via email

### Post-Launch Validation (Days 2-7)
- [ ] Track metrics: Players count, conversion rate, satisfaction, repeat rate

- Positive unit economics per jump

### NOT Doing (Keep It Simple)
- No automated ticket purchasing APIs
- No complex broker integrations
