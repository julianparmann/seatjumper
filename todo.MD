# SeatJumper Development Roadmap - POS Integration Focus

## Date: January 16, 2025
## Vision: Gamified ticket marketplace powered by broker POS systems

---

## MINIMAL MVP - IMMEDIATE TESTING (2-3 Days Total)
**Goal: Test if people will play the SeatJumper game with real money**

### Pre-Launch Setup (1-2 days)
- [ ] Manual Prize Pool Setup (Already Built)
  - Use existing admin inventory page to manually add tickets (100-level, 200-level, cheapest seats)
  - Use existing manual entry to add collectibles ($15 baseball packs + $1,000 grail card)
  - Set bundle price at profitable margin ($50-100 per jump)
- [ ] Test Payment Processing (Already Working)
  - Verify Stripe integration with $1 test transaction
  - Confirm webhook handling works
- [ ] Verify Core Jump Experience (Mostly Ready)
  - Test full flow end-to-end with stadium animation and winner reveal

### Launch Day (Day 1)
- [ ] Create one test game with 5-10 prize bundles
- [ ] Set game status to ACTIVE
- [ ] Share link with 10-20 friends/early testers
- [ ] Monitor first transactions in Stripe dashboard

### Manual Fulfillment Process
- [ ] Create tracking spreadsheet (winner name, email, prize won, delivery status)
- [ ] For ticket winners: Buy from StubHub/Ticketmaster manually, forward confirmation
- [ ] For collectible winners: Ship with tracking, send tracking info via email

### Post-Launch Validation (Days 2-7)
- [ ] Track metrics: Players count, conversion rate, satisfaction, repeat rate
- [ ] Use personal email for support (respond within 2 hours)
- [ ] Document all issues and feedback
- [ ] Iterate: Adjust pricing, prize mix, fix UX friction points

### Success Criteria
- 10+ real customers play with real money
- 80%+ satisfaction rate
- At least 2 repeat players
- Positive unit economics per jump

### NOT Doing (Keep It Simple)
- No automated ticket purchasing APIs
- No complex broker integrations
- No licensing/legal infrastructure
- No automated fulfillment
- No sophisticated fraud prevention

# TicketNetwork Mercury API Integration - Implementation Timeline

## Overview
Integrate TicketNetwork Mercury API for real-time ticket inventory while maintaining our randomization + memorabilia model.

**Business Model (Lock-First Approach):**
1. Customer selects bundle → We secretly randomize & lock tickets with Mercury
2. Customer proceeds to payment (prizes remain hidden)
3. Payment confirmed → We execute Mercury purchase for locked tickets
4. Reveal animation shows actual secured prizes

This ensures 100% delivery guarantee - we never show prizes we can't deliver!

---

## Week 1: Foundation & Mercury API Setup (Jan 20-24)
