📜 SeatJumper Terms of Service
Last Updated: October 1, 2025
These Terms of Service (“Terms”) form a legally binding agreement between you and SeatJumper, Inc. (“SeatJumper,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and govern your access to and use of our websites, mobile applications, and services (collectively, the “Services”).
By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you may not use the Services.
________________


1. Eligibility
* You must be at least 18 years old to use SeatJumper.

* The Services are available only to U.S. residents.

* Residents of certain states (e.g., New York, Florida, Rhode Island) may be excluded from Grail sweepstakes prizes unless and until SeatJumper complies with those states’ registration or bonding requirements.

* By using the Services, you represent that you meet these requirements.

________________


2. The SeatJumper Bundles
   * When you purchase a SeatJumper “Bundle,” you are buying a package of merchandise that includes:

      * Guaranteed memorabilia items (fulfilled directly by us or through third-party partners); and

      * Randomly allocated event tickets that may vary significantly in seating location and fair market value.

         * Ticket allocation within Bundles is random and may range from standard seating to premium seating.

         * All Bundle purchases are product sales, not sweepstakes prizes.

         * Sales tax may apply depending on the laws of the state where the memorabilia is delivered or where the event occurs.

         * All Bundle purchases are final and non-refundable, except as otherwise stated in Section 6 (Refunds & Cancellations).

________________


3. Grail Sweepstakes
            * In addition to Bundles, SeatJumper may run sweepstakes for designated “Grail” prizes (for example, Super Bowl tickets, World Series tickets, or other premium event access).

            * Entry into Grail sweepstakes may occur automatically with each eligible Bundle purchase, but no purchase is necessary to enter.

            * An Alternate Method of Entry (“AMOE”) is always available; full details are provided in the official sweepstakes rules posted on our site for each Grail promotion.

            * Only Grail prizes are considered sweepstakes prizes.

            * Odds of winning depend on the number of eligible entries received.

________________


4. Taxes
               * Grail winners must provide a completed IRS Form W-9 and any other required documentation before receiving their prize.

               * If your total Grail prize value in a calendar year is $600 or more, SeatJumper will issue an IRS Form 1099-MISC to you and file it with the IRS.

               * Winners are solely responsible for all federal, state, and local taxes associated with Grail prizes.

               * You are also responsible for any applicable sales or admissions taxes related to your Bundle purchases.

________________


5. User Accounts
                  * You may be required to create an account to use certain features.

                  * You must provide accurate, complete, and current information, and you agree to update your account details as needed.

                  * You are responsible for safeguarding your login credentials and all activity under your account.

                  * SeatJumper may suspend or terminate accounts that provide false information, engage in fraud, or otherwise violate these Terms.

6. Refunds & Cancellations
                     * All Bundle purchases are final.

                     * If an event associated with allocated tickets is canceled, SeatJumper or its ticketing partners may provide:

                        * Substitute tickets of comparable value, or

                        * A refund, at our sole discretion and consistent with applicable venue and ticketing partner policies.

                           * SeatJumper is not responsible for travel costs or other expenses incurred in connection with events.
