6. HOW TO ENTER
Entrants may receive a Prize, as defined below, by (i) purchasing Eligible Products or (ii) by submitting a mailed entry (an “Entry”) via the no purchase necessary method below. There is no purchase necessary to enter or win a Prize and any purchase of the Eligible Products will not increase Entrant’s chance of winning a Prize.
Purchase Entry: Eligible customers who purchase a SeatJumper Jump Bundle during the Sweepstakes Period will automatically receive entry into the Sweepstakes.
No Purchase Necessary (AMOE): For a chance to obtain Grail Cards, at the same odds, while supplies last, an Entrant must hand-print in ink on a piece of paper their full name, complete mailing address, telephone number and age, insert into a standard business size stamped envelope, and mail to:
SeatJumper HOLY GRAIL PACKAGE Sweepstakes Entry
1810 E Sahara Ave, STE 75115
Las Vegas, NV 89104 USA
Mail-in entries must be postmarked by January 1, 2026 and received no later than January 7, 2026. Upon Sponsor’s receipt of an Entry, an Entrant’s name will be entered to win a Prize.
Limit one entry per household per calendar quarter during the Sweepstakes Period. For clarity, eligible calendar quarters are: April 1, 2025 – June 30, 2025; July 1, 2025 – September 30, 2025; and October 1, 2025 – December 31, 2025. Entry in this Sweepstakes does not count as an entry into any other sweepstakes or contest.
The name of the person submitting the Entry must be the individual who completed the Entry. Entries that are forged, incomplete, illegible, altered, submitted by an individual that is not the Entrant, garbled or generated by a macro, bot, or other automated means will not be accepted and will be void. No photocopies, facsimiles, or mechanical reproductions will be accepted. Sponsor is not responsible for lost, late, mutilated, misdirected, illegible, incomplete, inaccurate, stolen, or postage-due Entries.
All Entries are and remain Sponsor’s exclusive property and will not be acknowledged, exchanged, modified, or returned. Entries must be received by Sponsor during the Sweepstakes Period to be considered for the Sweepstakes. Proof of an Entry (such as a copied, printed, or saved version of a “thank you” or confirmation message) is not proof of actual receipt or acceptance of an Entry.
AMOE Processing: Each AMOE entry received will be individually processed through the same computer-generated random number generator (RNG) methodology used for paid entries. This ensures that mail-in entrants have the exact same statistical odds of winning as purchase entrants.
________________


7. CONSENT TO COMMUNICATIONS
Each Entrant who submits an Entry thereby consents to receive communications from the Sponsor for the purpose of administering this Sweepstakes.
An Entrant who submits an Entry will not receive communications from the Sponsor about other offers and communications that may interest the Entrant unless the Entrant agrees to receive such communications independent of their participation in the Sweepstakes.

8. PRIZES
One (1) HOLY GRAIL PACKAGE, consisting of:
   * Two (2) Super Bowl tickets (February 2026); and

   * One (1) Grail Card valued at approximately $10,000.

A Winner will receive one (1) card from the list of Grail Cards included in the Eligible Product or a substitute Grail Card of similar rarity and value to those listed for the Eligible Product (“Prize(s)”). The specific Grail Card awarded will depend on the Eligible Product selected when submitting an Entry.
It is impossible to establish an exact value of a Prize or predict values based on several conditions such as current and local market conditions, which are subject to change.
Sponsor will not replace any lost, damaged, stolen, or undeliverable Prize. Sponsor is not responsible for any inability of a Winner to accept or use a Prize for any reason. No Prize substitutions or other consideration will be provided to a Winner, except in Sponsor’s sole discretion. Sponsor reserves the right and sole discretion to substitute a Prize or any portion thereof for an equal value Prize, as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion, for any reason, including, without limitation, Prize unavailability.
Approximate Retail Value (“ARV”): $30,000.

9. ODDS
Odds of winning are approximately 1 in 5,000 (0.02%). Actual odds depend on the total number of eligible entries received during the Sweepstakes Period.
________________


10. WINNER SELECTION
Each eligible Entry, whether submitted through a purchase or via AMOE, will be evaluated using a computer-generated random number generator (RNG) to ensure fairness and compliance.
      * For each eligible Entry received, a random number between 0 and 1 will be generated.

      * If the randomly generated number is less than 0.0002, that Entry will be deemed the Winner.

      * This process reflects the official 1-in-5,000 (0.02%) chance of winning.

________________

         * Potential winners will be notified via email and/or phone within three (3) business days.

         * To claim the prize, winners must complete and return, within three (3) business days of notification:

            * An Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability/Publicity Release; and

            * A completed IRS Form W-9 (since prize ARV exceeds $600).

               * Failure to timely respond or provide required documentation will result in forfeiture, and Sponsor may award the prize to an alternate winner.
